Software: The Internet & Racial Justice, from the AfroNet to Black Lives Matter","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Charlton D.","lastName":"McIlwain"}],"abstractNote":"Activists, pundits, politicians, and the press frequently proclaim today's digitally mediated racial justice activism the new civil rights movement. As Charlton D. McIlwain shows in this book, the story of racial justice movement organizing online is much longer and varied than most people know. In fact, it spans nearly five decades and involves a varied group of engineers, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, journalists, and activists. But this is a history that is virtually unknown even in our current age of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Black Lives Matter. Beginning with the simultaneous rise of civil rights and computer revolutions in the 1960s, McIlwain, for the first time, chronicles the long relationship between African Americans, computing technology, and the Internet. In turn, he argues that the forgotten figures who worked to make black politics central to the Internet's birth and evolution paved the way for today's explosion of racial justice activism. From the 1960s to present, the book examines how computing technology has been used to neutralize the threat that black people pose to the existing racial order, but also how black people seized these new computing tools to build community, wealth, and wage a war for racial justice.Through archival sources and the voices of many of those who lived and made this history, Black Software centralizes African Americans' role in the Internet's creation and evolution, illuminating both the limits and possibilities for using digital technology to push for racial justice in the United States and across the globe.","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"New York, NY","publisher":"Oxford University Press","date":"November 1,

Web","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anastasia","lastName":"Salter"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"John","lastName":"Murray"}],"abstractNote":"Adobe Flash began as a simple animation tool and grew into a multimedia platform that offered a generation of creators and innovators an astonishing range of opportunities to develop and distribute new kinds of digital content. For the better part of a decade, Flash was the de facto standard for dynamic online media, empowering amateur and professional developers to shape the future of the interactive Web. In this book, Anastasia Salter and John Murray trace the evolution of Flash into one of the engines of participatory culture. Salter and Murray investigate Flash as both a fundamental force that shaped perceptions of the web and a key technology that enabled innovative interactive experiences and new forms of gaming. They examine a series of works that exemplify Flash's role in shaping the experience and expectations of web multimedia. Topics include Flash as a platform for developing animation (and the \"Flashimation\" aesthetic); its capacities for scripting and interactive design; games and genres enabled by the reconstruction of the browser as a games portal; forms and genres of media art that use Flash; and Flash's stance on openness and standards--including its platform-defining battle over the ability to participate in Apple's own proprietary platforms. Flash's exit from the mobile environment in 2011 led some to declare that Flash was dead. But, as Salter and Murray show, not only does Flash live, but its role as a definitive cross-platform tool continues to influence web experience.","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","publisher":"The MIT Press","date":"August 29, 2014","numPages":"192","language":"English","ISBN":"978-0-262-02802-8","shortTitle":"Flash","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Amazon.com","callNumber":"üè∑Ô∏è #nosource„ÄÅ/unread","rights":"","extra":"00000\nCitation Key: Salter_2014_FlashBuildingInteractive","tags":[{"tag":"#nosource"},{"tag":"/unread","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2014-09-29T16:39:23Z","dateModified":"2025-04-24T20:27:59Z"}},{"key":"WAKWHPTV","version":443,"library":{"type":"group","id":1031,"name":"Critical Code Studies","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/1031/items/WAKWHPTV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies/items/WAKWHPTV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4613,"username":"markcmarino","name":"Mark Marino","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/markcmarino","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":6775075,"username":"lostwildland","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/lostwildland","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Pressman et al.","parsedDate":"2015-06-01","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"WAKWHPTV","version":443,"itemType":"book","title":"Reading Project: A Collaborative Analysis of William Poundstone's Project for Tachistoscope {Bottomless Pit}","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Pressman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mark C.","lastName":"Marino"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Douglass"}],"abstractNote":"Electronic literature is a rapidly growing area of creative production and scholarly interest. It is inherently multimedial and multimodal, and thus demands multiple critical methods of interpretation. Reading Project: A Collaborative Analysis of William Poundstone‚Äôs Project for Tachistoscope {Bottomless Pit} is a collaboration between three scholars combining different interpretive methods of digital literature and poetics in order to think through how critical reading is changing‚Äîand, indeed, must change‚Äîto keep up with the emergence of digital poetics and practices. It weaves together radically different methodological approaches‚Äîclose reading of onscreen textual and visual aesthetics, Critical Code Studies, and cultural analytics (big data)‚Äîinto a collaborative interpretation of a single work of digital literature.Project for the Tachistoscope {Bottomless Pit} is a work of electronic literature that presents a high-speed, one-word-at-a-time animation synchronized to visual and aural effects. It tells the tale of a mysterious pit and its impact on the surrounding community. Programmed in Flash and published online, its fast-flashing aesthetic of information overload bombards the reader with images, text, and sound in ways that challenge the ability to read carefully, closely, and analytically in traditional ways. The work‚Äôs multiple layers of poetics and programming can be most effectively read and analyzed through collaborative efforts at computational criticism such as is modeled in this book. The result is a unique and trailblazing book that presents the authors‚Äô collaborative efforts and interpretations as a case study for performing digital humanities literary criticism of born-digital poetics.","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"1 edition","place":"Iowa City","publisher":"University Of Iowa Press","date":"June 1,

Or, {llSay(0, \"Hello, Avatar!\"); is a tiny piece of user-friendly code that allows us to program our virtual selves. In  Hello Avatar, B. Coleman examines a crucial aspect of our cultural shift from analog to digital: the continuum between online and off-, what she calls the \"x-reality\" that crosses between the virtual and the real. She looks at the emergence of a world that is neither virtual nor real but encompasses a multiplicity of network combinations. And she argues that it is the role of the avatar to help us express our new agency -- our new power to customize our networked life.By avatar, Coleman means not just the animated figures that populate our screens but the gestalt of images, text, and multimedia that make up our online identities -- in virtual worlds like Second Life and in the form of email, video chat, and other digital artifacts. Exploring such network activities as embodiment, extreme (virtual) violence, and the work in virtual reality labs, and offering sidebar interviews with designers and practitioners, she argues that what is new is real-time collaboration and copresence, the way we make connections using networked media and the cultures we have created around this. The star of this drama of expanded horizons is the networked subject -- all of us who represent aspects of ourselves and our work across the mediascape.","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"Cambridge, Mass","publisher":"The MIT Press","date":"November 4, 2011","numPages":"216","language":"English","ISBN":"978-0-262-01571-4","shortTitle":"Hello Avatar","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Amazon","callNumber":"üè∑Ô∏è #nosource„ÄÅ/unread","rights":"","extra":"Citation Key: Coleman_2011_HelloAvatarRise","tags":[{"tag":"#nosource"},{"tag":"/unread","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-18T04:30:23Z","dateModified":"2025-04-24T20:27:50Z"}},{"key":"FXTYLWU9","version":443,"library":{"type":"group","id":1031,"name":"Critical Code Studies","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/1031/items/FXTYLWU9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies/items/FXTYLWU9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4613,"username":"markcmarino","name":"Mark Marino","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/markcmarino","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":6775075,"username":"lostwildland","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/lostwildland","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Bousquet and Wills","parsedDate":"2003","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"FXTYLWU9","version":443,"itemType":"book","title":"The Politics of Information: The Electronic Mediation of Social Change","creators":[{"creatorType":"editor","firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Bousquet"},{"creatorType":"editor","firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Wills"}],"abstractNote":"","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"","publisher":"Altx Press","date":"2003","numPages":"","language":"","ISBN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://www.altx.com/ebooks/download.cfm/infopol.pdf","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"üè∑Ô∏è #nosource„ÄÅ/unread","rights":"","extra":"Citation Key: Bousquet_2003_PoliticsInformationElectronic","tags":[{"tag":"#nosource"},{"tag":"/unread","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-18T04:34:12Z","dateModified":"2025-04-24T20:27:49Z"}},{"key":"77P8K9JH","version":443,"library":{"type":"group","id":1031,"name":"Critical Code Studies","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/1031/items/77P8K9JH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies/items/77P8K9JH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4613,"username":"markcmarino","name":"Mark Marino","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/markcmarino","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":6775075,"username":"lostwildland","name":"","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/lostwildland","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Westfall","parsedDate":"2001-10","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"77P8K9JH","version":443,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Technical Opinion: Hello, World Considered Harmful","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Westfall"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Commun.

We are so eager to do everything digitally--hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners--that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology--and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right. Making a case against technochauvinism--the belief that technology is always the solution--Broussard argues that it's just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia. To prove her point, she undertakes a series of adventures in computer programming. She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding \"the cyborg future is not coming any time soon\"; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can't pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software. If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone.\"--Amazon.com.","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","publisher":"The MIT Press","date":"2018","numPages":"","language":"eng","ISBN":"978-0-262-03800-3","shortTitle":"Artificial unintelligence","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Citation Key: Broussard_2018_Artificialunintelligencehow","tags":[{"tag":"#nosource"},{"tag":"/unread","type":1},{"tag":"Computer programs","type":1},{"tag":"Correctness","type":1},{"tag":"Electronic data processing","type":1},{"tag":"Errors","type":1},{"tag":"Social aspects","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-18T04:38:58Z","dateModified":"2025-04-24T20:27:23Z"}},{"key":"3KP79A9L","version":441,"library":{"type":"group","id":1031,"name":"Critical Code Studies","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/1031/items/3KP79A9L","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/groups/critical_code_studies/items/3KP79A9L","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"createdByUser":{"id":4613,"username":"markcmarino","name":"Mark Marino","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/markcmarino","type":"text/html"}}},"lastModifiedByUser":{"id":2273244,"username":"rkl25","name":"Ryan Leach","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/rkl25","type":"text/html"}}},"creatorSummary":"Skeem and Lowenkamp","parsedDate":"2020-04-17","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"3KP79A9L","version":441,"itemType":"report","title":"Using Algorithms to Address Trade-Offs Inherent in Predicting Recidivism","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer L.","lastName":"Skeem"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Lowenkamp"}],"abstractNote":"Although risk assessment has increasingly been used as a tool to help reform the criminal justice system, some stakeholders are adamantly opposed to using algorithms.  The principal concern is that any benefits achieved by safely reducing rates of incarceration will be offset by costs to racial justice claimed to be inherent in the algorithms themselves.  But fairness tradeoffs are inherent to the task of predicting recidivism, whether the prediction is made by an algorithm or human.  Based on a matched sample of 67,784 Black and White federal supervisees assessed with the Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA), we compare how three alternative strategies for ‚Äúdebiasing‚Äù algorithms affect these tradeoffs, using arrest for a violent crime as the criterion. These candidate algorithms all strongly predict violent re-offending (AUCs=.71-72), but vary in their association with race (r= .00-.21) and shift tradeoffs between balance in positive predictive value and false positive rates.  Providing algorithms with access to race (rather than omitting race or ‚Äòblinding‚Äô its effects) can maximize  calibration and minimize imbalanced error rates.  Implications for policymakers with value preferences for efficiency vs. equity are discussed.","reportNumber":"ID 3578591","reportType":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","seriesTitle":"","place":"Rochester, NY","institution":"Social Science Research Network","date":"2020/04/17","pages":"","language":"en","shortTitle":"","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3578591","accessDate":"2021-01-05T19:45:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"papers.ssrn.com","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3578591\nCitation Key: Skeem_2020_UsingAlgorithmsAddress","tags":[{"tag":"#nosource"},{"tag":"/unread","type":1},{"tag":"algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"bias","type":1},{"tag":"fairness","type":1},{"tag":"race","type":1},{"tag":"risk assessment","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-18T04:39:35Z","dateModified":"2025-04-24T20:27:23Z"}}]
